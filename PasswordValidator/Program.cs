Title: The Password Validator 
 
Story: 

The final task is to describe a class that represents a cocnept more abstract than the first four: a password validator. 
You must create a class that can determine if a password is valid (meets the rules defined for a legitmate password).
The rules for the task are below: 

- Passwords must be between 6 min and 13 maximum characters long.  

- Passwords must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number. 

- Passwords cannot contain an uppercase "T" or the ampersand symbol "&". 

- Hint: 
foreach with a string lets you get it's characters!
--> foreach(char letter in word) {...}
    
char has the static methods to ctaegrize letters! 
--> char.IsUpper('A'), char.IsLower('a'), char.IsDigit('0')
 

Objectives:

- Define a new Password validator class that can be given a password and determine if it is valid by the above rules 

- Make your main mehtod loop forever, asking for a password and reporting wheather or not it is valid using an instance of the PasswrodValidator class.
