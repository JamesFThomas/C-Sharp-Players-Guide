Title: Exepti's Game 



Story:
On the Island of Exceptions, you find the village of Exepti, which has seen little happiness since the arrival of the Uncoded One.
The Exceptians you to have a game they played call cookie exceptions. 
The village leader promises the warriors of Exepti will join you against the Uncoded One if you can recreate the ancient tradition in a program.   
The village will give you the Medallion of Exceptions as well.

Cookie exception is played by gathering nine chocolate chip cookies and one oatmeal raisin cookie. 
The cookies are mixed and put in a dark room with two players who can't see the cookies. 
Each player takes a turn picking a cookie randomly and shoving it into their mouths without seeing whether it is a delicious chocolate chip cookie or an awful oatmeal raisin.
If they pick wrong and eat the oatmeal cookie they lose. 
If their opponent eats the oatmeal cookie they win. 

Objective: 

- The game will pick a random number between 0 and 9.

- The game will allow players to take turns picking numbers between 0 and 9.

- If a player repeats a number that has already been used the program should make them select another.
    --> Hint: If you use a List<T> to store previously chosen numbers, you can use its Contains method to see if a number has been used before.  

- If the number matches the one the game picked initially, an exception should be thrown, terminating the program. 
    --> Run the program at least once like this to see it crash. 

- Put in a try catch block to handle the exception and display the result. 

- Answer this question: Did you make a custom Exception type or use a existing one? Why did you chose to do what you did? 
   =>

- Answer this question: You could write this program without exceptions for learning purposes. If you didn't have that requirement, would you have used an exception? Why or why not?
