Title: Time In Cavern 


Story:

With dateTime and TimeSpan, you can track how much time a player spend in the Cavern of Objects to beat the game.
With these tools, modify your Fountain Of Objects game to display how much time a player spent exploring the caverns. 


Objectives:

- When a new game begins, capture the current time by using DateTime

- When a game finished ( win ,loss, or quit ) capture the current time
 
- Use TimeSpan to compute how much time elapsed between the start and end of the game and display the result to the player
