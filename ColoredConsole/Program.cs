Title: Colored Console


Story: 

The medallion of Large Solutions lies behind a sealed stone door and can only be unlocked by building a solution with two correctly linked projects. 
this multi-project solution is the key that unseals the door. 


Objectives:

- Create a new console application from scratch.

- Add a second Class Library project to the solution. 

- Add the method public static string Prompt(string question) that writes question to the console window, then switches to cyan to get the user's response all on the same line.

- Add the method public static void WriteLine(string text, ConsoleColor color) that writes the given text on its own line in the given color. 

- Add the method public static void Write(string text, ConsoleColor color) that writes the given text without a new line in the given color.  

- Add the right references between projects so that the main program can use the following code.  

string name = ColorConsole.Prompt("What is your name")
ColorConsole.WriteLine("Hello " + nae, ConsoleColor.Green);
