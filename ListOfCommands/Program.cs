Title: List Of Commands 


Story:

In level 27 we encountered a robot with an array to hold commands to run. 
But we could make the robot have as many commands as we want by turning the array into a list.
Revisit that challenge to make the robot a list instead of an array, and add commands to run until the user says stop.


Objectives:

- Change Robot class to use a List<IRobotCommand> instead of an array for its Command property.  

- Instead of looping three times, go until the user types stop. Then run all the command created.
