# Welcome to My C# Adventure!

This repository is my personal quest log as I navigate the exciting world of the C# Players Guide.

While I'm not a complete novice, I wouldn't call myself a master yet—I'm somewhere in that exhilarating space between! My skills have been self-taught, accumulated from various tutorials and resources, and I'm using this course to fill in the gaps and discover the best practices of C# programming.

Join me on this journey as I aim to complete the quest and harness the skills I learn to build full-stack applications that continue to challenge my skills and allow me to grow.

"Every journey begins with a single step."
